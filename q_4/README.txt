How to run Q4: 
1. Open a terminal in the folder where the source files are located (dir_traversal.c, makefile). 
2. In the terminal run the make command 
This command will compile the dir_traversal.c file into an executable file named dir_traversal 
3. Now run the command 
./dir_traversal <name> 
Instead of <name> we will insert the folder / file name from which we want to start. 
 
output: 
  The first letter that appears will symbolize the type, the number will be the inode   and then the name of the folder / file will appear.
