 How to run Q2.1
1. Open a terminal in the folder where the source files are located (check_pid.c, makefile). 
2. In the terminal run the MAKE command 
This command will compile the check_pid.c file into a run file named check_pid. 
3. Now run the command ./check_pid <number> 
Instead of <number> we enter the process number that we want to check. 
       output: 
 Does your walk exist / exist but we do not have permissions to it / does not exist.
